For simplicity, let's assume the PDF follows a normal distribution with a mean of 175 cm and a standard deviation of 10 cm.\n",
    "The PDF would indicate the probability density at different height values. For instance, the PDF might show that the probability density is highest around the mean height of 175 cm and gradually decreases as the height deviates from the mean.\n",
    "It's important to note that the PDF does not give the probability of obtaining a specific value, as the probability for any individual value is infinitesimally small in a continuous distribution. Instead, the PDF allows us to calculate the probability of the random variable falling within a certain range, by integrating the PDF over that range.\n",

    "Height of individuals: The heights of adult individuals tend to follow a normal distribution. Although there can be slight deviations from a perfect normal distribution due to factors like gender differences, the normal distribution provides a reasonable approximation for modeling height data in a population.\n",
    "Test scores: When a large number of individuals take a standardized test, such as the SAT or GRE, the distribution of test scores often exhibits a bell-shaped curve. The normal distribution can be used to model the scores and analyze their characteristics.\n",
    "Measurement errors: In many scientific experiments and observations, measurement errors can occur due to various factors. These errors are often assumed to be normally distributed around the true value, and the normal distribution is used as a model for representing such errors.\n",
    "Stock market returns: Daily or monthly returns in financial markets are often modeled using the normal distribution, assuming that the changes in stock prices follow a random and continuous process. This assumption allows for the use of various statistical and risk analysis techniques.\n",
    "Now, let's discuss how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution. The normal distribution is defined by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ).\n",
    "Mean (μ): The mean determines the central location or the average value of the distribution. It corresponds to the highest point of the bell curve. Shifting the mean to the left or right shifts the entire distribution along the x-axis without changing its shape.\n",
    "Standard deviation (σ): The standard deviation measures the dispersion or spread of the distribution. A larger standard deviation indicates a wider spread of data points, resulting in a flatter and broader bell curve. Conversely, a smaller standard deviation results in a narrower and taller bell curve.\n",
    "Together, the mean and standard deviation fully characterize the shape of the normal distribution. They determine the location, symmetry, and width of the distribution, allowing for the calculation of probabilities and the analysis of data within the distribution.\n",
